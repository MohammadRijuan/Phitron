/* -- Write the difference between Primary Key and Composite Primary Key

1. A primary key is a unique identifier for a single row within a database table
2. A composite primary key consists of two or more columns that together uniquely identify each row in a table.

diffrences->
1. there can only be one primary key per table
2. Typically consists of a single column, often an auto-incremented integer or a uniquely identifying attribute.
3.  Primary key is a single column, whereas composite primary key is made up of multiple columns.
4. Primary key enforces uniqueness on its own column, while composite primary key enforces uniqueness across the combination of columns.

/* Write the difference between using JOIN Query and not using JOIN query

1. A JOIN syntax in mySQL combines rows from two or more tables along with column between them.
2. Without using JOIN syntax, we might retrieve data separately from each table and manually link them using application code or by running multiple queries.
3. In many ways, database optimize JOIN syntax, resulting in efficient query execution compared to mannual methods.
4. Mannual linking can lead to complex relation and error-prone code, especially when contacting with more than two tables or complex relationships.
Example->
SUPPOSE THERE ARE TWO TABLE ONE IS EMPLOYEES AND 2ND ONE IS DEPARTMENTS 

-- without using join syntax how we can join two table
-- WE CAN WRITE THIS ONE TOO

-- SELECT FIRST_NAME,DEPARTMENT_NAME
SELECT EMPLOYEES.FIRST_NAME , DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME -- THIS ONE IS FOR BEST PRACTICE TO UNDERSTAND
FROM EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID=DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID;


-- USING JOIN SYNTAX

FROM EMPLOYEES 
             JOIN DEPARTMENTS ON EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID = DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID;
